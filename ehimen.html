			<h1><strong>My Experience So far At Code Plateau<strong></h1>
			<p>My experience so far at the Code Plateau Boot Camp so far has been wonderful, educative, and fun. Through out thr period of the two weeks I've  been able to know and understand what it takes to be a software developer, how a software developer thinks and how the apply their knowledge of programming and skills towards solving problems in their immediate enviroment and profering lasting and handy solution using the latest technology.<br>During the course of this trainig we were also introduced to different aspects of software developemnt which will help us through our surgon in the software development in the boot camp. </p>

			<p>They include;</p>
		
		
			<ul>
				<li>Web/Mobile development</li>
				<li>Augumented Reality & Virtual Reality (AR & VR)</li>
				<li>UI/UX and Hosting/Dev options etc</li>
			
			</ul>


			<p>However its just bearly two weeks and I can tell that i've been able to improve my thinking skills and also learnt how to use Git, Github, Ubuntu Linux OS, HTML etc. <br> I indeed have no regrets to be part of this program.<p/>
